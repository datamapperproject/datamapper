In road pricing, drivers are charged toll fees when they use specific roads. This aims to discourage driving unless absolutely necessary, and is usually used to regulate cars going into city centres or using high-end roads like expressways.\n\nOne notable example is Singapore\u2019s Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system, which uses electronic gates to automatically charge drivers passing through, without needing drivers to slow down or queue to pay toll fees in cash.\n\nWhile road pricing has been shown to work in Singapore and London, it is not always an appropriate solution. There have to be alternative ways for people to get to their destinations; for example, Singapore has invested into public transportation so that people do not need to drive to move from their homes to their jobs in the city centre.\n\nThis might not be a good solution for cities that do not have the infrastructure to give people alternatives. It is also a hard policy to sell to voters, especially in countries that have a deep car culture. If a government is sure that they want to do road pricing, they must convince citizens that this is beneficial for them while also making the effort to mitigate negative outcomes such as lower-income workers being unable to access jobs.\n\nThis is why it is important to adapt all solutions, including road pricing, to the local context."

In community gardens, residents collectively cultivate fruits, vegetables, and herbs, often on city-owned or communal land. These green pockets not only provide fresh, locally grown produce but also serve as spaces for social interaction and skill-sharing among community members.\n\nOne exemplary case is the \"P-Patch\" program in Seattle, Washington, which has successfully established over 50 community gardens throughout the city. These gardens have become essential components of neighborhood life, promoting urban sustainability while also offering a sense of belonging and community pride.\n\nHowever, the viability of community gardens can vary based on local factors. It's essential to ensure that adequate land is available for garden plots and that there's community interest and commitment to maintaining the gardens. Additionally, successful community garden initiatives often require ongoing support and education to help residents maximize their gardening potential.\n\nThis solution may not be universally suitable, especially in densely populated urban areas with limited available land. In such cases, vertical or rooftop gardening may be explored as alternatives. Moreover, cultural and demographic factors should be considered, as community gardening may not align with the preferences or traditions of all residents.\n\nTo effectively implement community gardens, local governments and community organizations should tailor their approaches to suit the specific needs and interests of the area. Building partnerships with local schools, businesses, and non-profits can help provide resources, education, and a sense of shared responsibility, ensuring that community gardens thrive and contribute positively to the local urban environment"
